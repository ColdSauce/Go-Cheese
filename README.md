# Go Cheese
Go Cheese is a Go library that provides convenient functions to control the mouse and the keyboard. (Similar to Java's Robot)

It's currently extremely limited and is not ready to be used in any sort of serious setting.

The goal of this library is to be able to be used in as many operating systems as possible. Currently the following are the only ones that are supported:
- Windows

There is currently development being done to get this library working with the X Window System.
