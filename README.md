# Got'em
Got'em is a Go library that provides convenient functions to control the mouse and the keyboard. (Similar to Java's Robot)

It's currently extremely limited and is not ready to be used in any sort of serious setting.

It can only be used on Windows (Shocker, am I right? Usually Windows support is the one that is most lacking :p ) However, I am planning on creating functionality for users of the X Window System.
