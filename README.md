# Got'em
Got'em is a Go library that provides convenient functions to control the mouse and the keyboard. (Similar to Java's Robot)

It's currently extremely limited and is not ready to be used in any sort of serious setting.

Works for Windows. Still no unit tests, though. So don't assume it's reliable (to be honest, I have no idea how to do unit tests for something like this) Getting it working for the X Window System soon.
